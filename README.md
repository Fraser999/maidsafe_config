# maidsafe_config

Before using this script, see the maidsafe forums for info re. installing libsodium and other environment tweaks.
Make sure you have the latest stable version of rustc and cargo from http://rust-lang.org.
You'll want to set these in your .bashrc:

  export SODIUM_LIB_DIR=/usr/local/lib

  export RUST_TEST_THREADS=1
  

Run the script with no arguments to see the options.

./runner.py
